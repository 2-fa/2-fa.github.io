<p><strong>2-factor authentication</strong> (2FA) is cloud messaging security solution that confirms the identity of the user and protects the system from phishing or hacking attacks.</p>

<p>A one-time PIN (PIN code) is generated and sent to the user’s mobile phone. The user receives the PIN code and types it into the application to confirm his or her identity. If the PIN number that was sent out to the user matches the one that is received, the user is allowed to continue with the process.</p>

<ol>
<li>User enter his phone number into the client’s application (mobile or web). The other option is that client pulls the phone number from his user’s database.</li>
<li>Application sends the request for the PIN code with user’s phone number to Infobip.</li>
<li>Infobip sends Number context lookup request to the MNO for user’s phone number.</li>
<li>Infobip receives Number context lookup response from the MNO.</li>
<li>Infobip sends Number context response to the Application.</li>
<li>If the Number context result is valid, Infobip generates the PIN code and send it via SMS.</li>
<li>MNO delivers SMS with the PIN code.</li>
<li>Infobip receives Delivery report for sent message.</li>
<li>User enters the received PIN code into the application.</li>
<li>Application sends verification request with the PIN code.</li>
<li>Infobip verifies the received PIN and sends the response to the application.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> <br>
  <strong>Steps 3</strong> and <strong>4</strong> are important for the clients that want to check whether the user entered valid phone number before sending a verification SMS. We use Number context to check the phone number validity. If the phone number is not valid (i.e. doesn’t exists) we do not even generate the PIN code and send the SMS. This way we prevent unnecessary expenditures for our clients. These steps are optional due to customer needs.</p>

<h2 id="one-time-pin-generating-algorithm">One Time PIN generating algorithm</h2>

<p>We used a variant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm">Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)</a> algorithm (in compliance with <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238">RFC 6238</a>) for generating PINs. We combine secret key with current timestamp to seed secure pseudo-random number generator (512-bit time-dependent seed) which in turn produces 512-bit pseudo-random number which is an input to SHA512, along with time-dependent key. We reseed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator">PRNG</a> periodically with time-based pseudo-random seed, but time-independently of hashing algorithm input time-dependent key.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2104.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2104.html</a></p>
  
  <p>…for a block length of 64 bytes this [“birthday attack” on 128-bit MD5] would take 250,000 years in a continuous 1Gbps link, and without changing the secret key K during all this time…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don’t use MD5, we use <strong>HmacSHA512</strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Comparison_of_SHA_functions">SHA functions comparison</a>), which is much more resistant to this type of attack. Paired with dynamically seeded PRNG and time-dependant key, one would only have a few seconds to try this kind of attack on hashing function before it’s key is changed. And this attack becomes possible only if PRNG is also breaked, which is as unfeasible as the very MD5 attack just presented (only in another terms).</p>

<p>Other than that, the length of PIN code influences probability of repeating PINs, but an 6-digit numeric only PIN has 10^6 = 1.000.000 combinations (6-digit alphanumeric ~&gt; 10^11 combinations). So if you try to guess PIN code by brute forcing it’s value, you have pretty low probability of guessing it blindly. And, when you setup your 2FA application, you can limit the number of verification attempts to arbitrary value, further limiting lucky guesses.</p>
