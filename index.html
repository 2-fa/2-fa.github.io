<p><strong>2-Factor Authentication</strong> (2FA) is cloud messaging security solution that confirms the identity of the user and protects the system from phishing or hacking attacks.</p>

<p>A one-time PIN (PIN code) is generated and sent to the userâ€™s mobile phone. The user receives the PIN code and types it into the application to confirm his or her identity. If the PIN number that was sent out to the user matches the one that is received, the user is allowed to continue with the process.</p>
